# Titanic-EDA-Kaggale-Data-Set-
ðŸš¢ Titanic EDA : I explored the Titanic dataset to understand passenger survival patterns. After cleaning missing values, I analyzed how factors like Gender, Passenger Class, Fare, and Family size impacted survival.Using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I visualized key patterns, correlations, and uncovered meaningful insights from the data.
